# predict-rlm
Production focused Self-harnessed LM runtime (RLM) that allows the LM to call its sub-lm with [DSPy](https://dspy.ai) signatures. Define your inputs, outputs, and tools — the model handles its own control flow. Get fully interpretable trajectories and performance that scales directly with model improvements. Without context rot.

Based on the [Recursive Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601v1) paper by [Alex L. Zhang](https://x.com/a1zhang), [Tim Kraska](https://x.com/tim_kraska), and [Omar Khattab](https://x.com/lateinteraction) from MIT CSAIL.<br/>

## Why RLMs?

</p>

- **Avoid context rot** —  The root LM only interacts with its context programmatically through the REPL, staying well within its comfortable operating range — enabling complex, long-horizon tasks that would otherwise cause models to silently degrade.
- **Bitter lesson-proof: RLMs improve as LMs improve** — Unlike harnesses, which can cap or constrain the base model's capabilities, the performance, speed, and cost of RLM calls correlate directly with improvements to base model capabilities. [If the base model handles 10M tokens tomorrow, the RLM handles 100M.](https://alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2025/rlm/)
- **Symbolic reasoning & recursion** — like algebra, RLMs express the *structure* of computation rather than performing each operation individually; a single line can represent 1M sub-calls — in direct contrast to agents like Claude Code that must mechanically emit each sub-agent call one at a time.
- **Interpretability** — RLM trajectories are fully readable: you can trace every peek, chunk, sub-call, and verification step the model takes. This not only reveals *how* the model decomposed a problem, but provides concrete optimization signals which tools like [GEPA](https://gepa-ai.github.io/gepa) can ingest to evolve the RLM's strategies.
- **Ideal for improving performance per token** — RLMs allow small models to punch way above their weight (RLM(GPT-5-mini) outperforms base GPT-5) providing great opportunities for reducing costs or stretching limited compute budgets without sacrificing quality.

## Features

</p>


- **Multimodal** — process images, documents, audio, and video through sub-LM calls using native provider multimodal APIs. 
- **Async tool calling** — native RLM async support in the WASM sandbox, enabling concurrent sub-LM invocations and tool calls
- **Prompt-optimized skills & tools** — predict-rlm skills comes tested and optimized to ensure maximum LM interoperability and performance, bundling instructions, PyPI packages, and tools for domain-specific tasks
- **Simple file I/O** — pass local or cloud files as typed inputs and outputs via `File`, keeping interop with your existing data pipelines straightforward. (S3 files support soon)
- **Structured sub-LM calls** — native Pydantic and DSPy signature support for type-safe sub-LM invocations with structured outputs

## Quick start

### With your coding agent

Install the [predict-rlm skill](.agents/skills/rlm/SKILL.md) in Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or any compatible coding agent:

```bash
npx skills add Trampoline-AI/predict-rlm
```

Then ask your agent to build an RLM:

```
❯ /rlm build an RLM that extracts line items from PDF invoices into a spreadsheet
```

### Quick Example

```python
import dspy
from predict_rlm import File, PredictRLM

class AnalyzeImages(dspy.Signature):
    """Analyze images and answer the query. Load each image as a base64 data
    URI and use predict() with dspy.Image to extract visual information."""
    images: list[File] = dspy.InputField()
    query: str = dspy.InputField()
    answer: str = dspy.OutputField()

rlm = PredictRLM(
    AnalyzeImages,
    lm="openai/gpt-5.4",
    sub_lm="openai/gpt-5.1",
)

result = rlm(
    images=[File(path="page.png")],
    query="Extract all visible text, then count each letter A-Z (case-insensitive).",
)

print(result.answer)
```

### Using the spreadsheet skill

The optimized spreadsheet skill is built in. Import it and pass it through `skills=[spreadsheet]` so the RLM gets the spreadsheet-specific instructions, `openpyxl`, `pandas`, `formulas`, and the `formula_eval` verification module inside its sandbox.

```python
import dspy

from predict_rlm import File, PredictRLM
from predict_rlm.skills import spreadsheet


class UpdateWorkbook(dspy.Signature):
    """Update the workbook following the request.

    Use openpyxl for workbook edits, Excel formulas for derived values, and
    verify formulas before returning the final .xlsx file.
    """

    workbook: File = dspy.InputField(desc="Input .xlsx workbook")
    request: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Requested spreadsheet changes")
    updated_workbook: File = dspy.OutputField(desc="Updated .xlsx workbook")


rlm = PredictRLM(
    UpdateWorkbook,
    lm="openai/gpt-5.4",
    sub_lm="openai/gpt-5.1",
    skills=[spreadsheet],
)

result = rlm(
    workbook=File(path="model.xlsx"),
    request="Add a Summary sheet with revenue by quarter and formulas for totals.",
)

print(result.updated_workbook.path)
```

For workflows that combine source documents and spreadsheets, compose skills:

```python
from predict_rlm.skills import pdf, spreadsheet

rlm = PredictRLM(ProcessInvoices, skills=[pdf, spreadsheet])
```

### Using GitHub Copilot OAuth (community)

If you have a GitHub Copilot subscription, you can use it as the LM backend via the community [`copilot-dspy`](https://github.com/linm1/copilot-dspy) adapter — no separate API key needed. See [examples/copilot_oauth/](examples/copilot_oauth/) for setup instructions and risks (ToS, no upstream license, fragility).
